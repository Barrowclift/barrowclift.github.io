### Heading (h3)

#### Heading (h4)

This is sample text to represent a paragraph this is what a block of test will look like. Now I'm just going to write a ton of bullshit and hope that it looks good when processed with an appropriate markdown style sheet. I hope it will all look okay in the end my god this is a pain in the god damn ass I can't wait for this to be done.

Here is a block quote:

> > This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
> > consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.
> > Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
> 
> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse
> id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

This problem isn't exclusive to government whistle blowers; journalists and authors wishing to publish works under a pen name may also be at risk with these rising technologies. For _example_, J.K. Rowling's recent work The Cuckoo's Calling **was** originally published under the alias, Robert Galbraith. Using JGAAP, an authorship detection tool he developed, Patrick Juola made a strong case for Rowling being the true author. This ultimately led to her confession (see here for the whole story).

Here's a picture I found that I think articulates my point really well. This problem isn't exclusive to government whistle blowers; journalists and authors wishing to publish works under a pen name may also be at risk with these rising technologies. For _example_, J.K. Rowling's recent work The Cuckoo's Calling **was** originally published under the alias, Robert Galbraith. Using JGAAP, an authorship detection tool he developed, Patrick Juola made a strong case for Rowling being the true author. This ultimately led to her confession (see here for the whole story). This is a very troubling issue, especially in light of the NSA's Prism reveal, which makes it very easy for them to attribute anonymous publications simply by __checking__ it against their databases and using *existing* tools such as `JGAAP and JStylo`. This means that whistle blowers, who wish to remain anonymous, may be unknowingly revealing themselves whenever they post new material.

The members were as follows:

1. Dr. Frank Lee - Project head, original idea
2. Dr. Santiago Ontanon - Pong, assistant programmer
3. Gaylord Holder - Networking, LED map parser, assistant programmer
4. Marc Barrowclift - Display manager, Tetris, Snake, and GUI game tester

Also, it's important that I get unordered lists to look nice as well. Here's an example of one of those unordered lists:

* This is a test
* So is this
* La de da de da de da
* Foo bar

As you can see, this is a huge problem, but what can we do to protect ourselves? Enter Anonymouth. Anonymouth has grown enormously over the past two years and is just nearing a stable 0.6 Beta. While there is still much work to be done, its current version provides users with the basic tools necessary to help them begin anonymizing their documents.
