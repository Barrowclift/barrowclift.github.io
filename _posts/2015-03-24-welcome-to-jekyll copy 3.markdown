You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

There's a cool thing with pictures as well. Here's a picture:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/Images/Largest-Video-Game-Ever/controller.jpg){: .full-width}
{: .full-width .parallax__layer .parallax__layer--back}

That's one thing, here's another thing. Blah blah blah I don't know what to type this is so close ot being done.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight java %}
/** My test class */
public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, world!");
		System.out.println("This is another test");
		int i = 5;
		int b = 2;
		int result = i + b;
		return;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

By using current technology, you can be identified based on nothing more than your writing style ([See the Privacy, Security, and Automation lab's publications here](https://psal.cs.drexel.edu/index.php/Research)). This is a very troubling issue, especially in light of the NSA's Prism reveal, which makes it very easy for them to attribute anonymous publications simply by checking it against their databases and using existing tools such as JGAAP and JStylo. This means that whistle blowers, who wish to remain anonymous, may be unknowingly revealing themselves whenever they post new material[^interesting]

This problem isn't exclusive to government whistle blowers; journalists and authors wishing to publish works under a pen name may also be at risk with these rising technologies. For example, J.K. Rowling's recent work The Cuckoo's Calling was originally published under the alias, Robert Galbraith[^camelot]. Using JGAAP, an authorship detection tool he developed, Patrick Juola made a strong case for Rowling being the true author. This ultimately led to her confession (see here for the whole story).

The members were as follows:

1. Dr. Frank Lee - Project head, original idea. This is a test of the thing. doo dee doo This is the first item.
2. Dr. Santiago Ontanon - Pong, assistant programmer
3. Gaylord Holder - Networking, LED map parser, assistant programmer
4. Marc Barrowclift - Display manager, Tetris, Snake, and GUI game tester

As you can see, this is a huge problem, but what can we do to protect ourselves? Enter Anonymouth. Anonymouth has grown enormously over the past two years and is just nearing a stable 0.6 Beta. While there is still much work to be done, its current version provides users with the basic tools necessary to help them begin anonymizing their documents.
