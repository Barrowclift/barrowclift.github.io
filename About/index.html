<p>Hi! My name is Marc Barrowclift and I'm a software engineer and accidental human interface designer. I grew up in a sleepy Illinois town and spent my early years pounding away at the piano, performing in musical theater, and filming hours of home movies with friends.</p>

<p>I continued playing with these hobbies until finally &#8212; with my family's ancient Compaq tower on it's last leg &#8212; my dad placed an order for something that would leave a deep and profound effect on me and my future ambitions; an <a href="http://c1.zzounds.com/media/fit,2018by3200/quality,85/iMac20_PF_TigerDesktop_PRINT-a4d2f7949400863d4c4456c4a9dafc33.jpg">iMac</a>.</p>

<p>The frame I had previously used when interacting with computers vanished. Using the computer was no longer simply a means to some end, no longer just a mechanical, motorized interaction that would leave you feeling mentally drained.</p>

<p>Computers could be <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>Computers were not simply a work or school desk, no, but a playground. They were something that could delight and tempt those sharing in the experience to explore and learn everything they could about it. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_(user_interface)">lickable buttons</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/uGMQLfi0kGc?t=1h47m2s">smooth animations</a>, and <a href="http://origin.arstechnica.com/video/leopard-intro.mov">various surprises</a> were carefully laid candies along the trail to tempt those to learn and discover for themselves, and I happily did.</p>

<p>As the years went on I became increasingly aware of the "man behind the curtains" running that bubbly OS X I had spent my high school years exploring. With this increased awareness came the realization that <em>actual people made this</em>. There were incredibly motivated and smart people somewhere that created the marvelous fusion of arts and engineering before me and I too could contribute.</p>

<p class="large-bottom-pad">This website is my first step towards that goal and will serve as my hub to share what I have learned with the community and display new creations as they come. I hope you'll consider taking this journey with me; it's going to be one hell of a ride. Cheers! &#x1F37A;</p>
