THIS IS THE IMPORTANT ONE 🍻 By using current technology, you can be identified based on nothing more than your writing style ([See the Privacy, Security, and Automation lab's publications here](https://psal.cs.drexel.edu/index.php/Research)). This is a very troubling issue, especially in light of the NSA's Prism reveal, which makes it very easy for them to attribute anonymous publications simply by __checking__ it against their databases and using *existing* tools such as `JGAAP and JStylo`. This means that whistle blowers, who wish to remain anonymous, "may be unknowingly revealing" themselves whenever they post new material.

Here is a block quote:

This problem isn't exclusive to government whistle blowers; journalists and authors wishing to publish works under a pen name may also be at risk with these rising technologies. For _example_, J.K. Rowling's recent work The Cuckoo's Calling **was** originally published under the alias, Robert Galbraith. Using JGAAP, an authorship detection tool he developed, Patrick Juola made a strong case for Rowling being the true author. This ultimately led to her confession (see here for the whole story).

Here's a picture I found that I think articulates my point really well.

Look at it. LOOK AT IT! This problem isn't exclusive to government whistle blowers; journalists and authors wishing to publish works under a pen name may also be at risk with these rising technologies. For _example_, J.K.

The members were as follows:

1. Dr. Frank Lee - Project head, original idea. This is a test of a lot of text in a bulleted or listed item. I wonder how it will look.
2. Dr. Santiago Ontanon - Pong, assistant programmer
3. Gaylord Holder - Networking, LED map parser, assistant programmer
4. Marc Barrowclift - Display manager, Tetris, Snake, and GUI game tester

Also, it's important that I get unordered lists to look nice as well. Here's an example of one of those unordered lists:

* This is a test
* So is this
* La de da de da de da
* Foo bar

As you can see, this is a huge problem, but what can we do to protect ourselves? Enter Anonymouth. Anonymouth has grown enormously over the past two years and is just nearing a stable 0.6 Beta. While there is still much work to be done, its current version provides users with the basic tools necessary to help them begin anonymizing their documents.
