	<h3 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h3>

	<p>Anonymouth is a tool that anyone can use in order to remove their style &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; from documents that they write, effectively rendering the document anonymous. I was part of its development team at Drexel University's <a href="https://psal.cs.drexel.edu/index.php/Main_Page"> Privacy, Security and Automation Lab.</a></p>
	
	<h3 id="why-should-you-care">Why Should You Care?</h3>

	<p>
		By using current technology, you can be identified based on nothing more than your writing style (<a href="https://psal.cs.drexel.edu/index.php/Research">See the Privacy, Security, and Automation lab's publications here</a>). This is a very troubling issue, especially in light of the NSA's Prism reveal, which makes it very easy for them to attribute anonymous publications simply by checking it against their databases and using existing tools such as <a href="http://evllabs.com/jgaap/w/index.php/Main_Page">JGAAP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/psal/jstylo">JStylo</a>. This means that whistle blowers, who wish to remain anonymous, may be unknowingly revealing themselves whenever they post new material.<br><br>

		This problem isn't exclusive to government whistle blowers; journalists and authors wishing to publish works under a pen name may also be at risk with these rising technologies. For example, J.K. Rowling's recent work <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo's_Calling" style="text-decoration: underline;">The Cuckoo's Calling</a> was originally published under the alias, Robert Galbraith. Using JGAAP, an authorship detection tool he developed, <a href="http://www.duq.edu/academics/faculty/patrick-juola">Patrick Juola</a> made a strong case for Rowling being the true author. This ultimately led to her confession (<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Professor-Who-Declared/140595/">see here for the whole story</a>).<br><br>

		As you can see, this is a huge problem, but what can we do to protect ourselves? Enter Anonymouth. Anonymouth has grown enormously over the past two years and is just nearing a stable 0.6 Beta. While there is still much work to be done, its current version provides users with the basic tools necessary to help them begin anonymizing their documents.

	<h3 id="where-can-you-get-it">Where Can You Get It?</h3>

	<p>Since it's still in development, currently the only way to get Anonymouth is to download and build it yourself using the command line or an IDE like Eclipse. You can find the most recent stable commits on the <a href="https://github.com/psal/anonymouth">lab's GitHub page</a>. Please read the ReadMe carefully. While Anonymouth is an incredibly userful and powerful tool, please remember that it is still in beta and bugs may still arise.</p>

	<p>While I ceased involvement with the Anonymouth project in 2011, the project is still in active development and eager for new contributers. If you're interested feel free to request a fork on the project's <a href="https://github.com/psal/anonymouth">Github page</a>.</p>
