		On April 19th, 2013 nearly one hundred people gathered outside the Philadelphia Art Museum, awaiting the kick-off event of <a href="http://www.phillytechweek.com">Philly Tech Week</a>. Their eyes focused on Philadelphia's beautiful Cira Center, which, constructed with hundreds of brilliant LED lights in its windows, occasionally lit up with simple images or animations. On that day, however, they were there to witness (or even play!) the largest video game of all time using these LED lights.<br><br>

		How did this all come to fruition? <a href="http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~fjl24/">Dr. Frank Lee</a>, a game design professor at Drexel University, had a vision of Tetris blocks falling on the side of the Cira Center and spent five years climbing the corporate ladder in an attempt to make his vision a reality. A few months before Philly Tech Week began, he finally received the required approval and immediately assembled a team of Drexel colleagues and students to make the dream a reality. I was on of the three people selected for Dr. Lee's Team.<br><br>

		The next couple of months were extremely busy. Designing the actual game was easy, but overriding the existing system to establish control and make it perform like a computer display proved to be a difficult process. It required a great deal of collaboration with <a href="http://www.brandywinerealty.com">Brandywine Reality Trust</a> (the Cira Center's owners) for everything from getting building access and a VPN setup to providing us with information regarding the LEDs and their mapping. After countless tests and setbacks (such as lights not mapped correctly, burnt out colors, etc.) out team finally created a suite of software scripts that allowed us to control the display just like one would a standard computer screen.
